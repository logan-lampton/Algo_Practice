// very similar to a binary search tree but with some different rules

// MaxBinaryHeap: parent nodes are always larger than the child nodes

// MinBinaryHeap: parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

// Nodes in binary heaps can only have AT MOST two children
// Unlike binary search trees, there is no order to the nodes (so NOT left is smaller, right is larger)

// Binary Heaps are used to implement Priority Queues, which are VERY commonly used data structures
// Binary Heaps are also used quie a bit with graph traversal algorithms
