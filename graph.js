// Wikipedia definition of a graph: 
// A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph, or a set of ordered pairs for a directed graph.

// Layman's terms:
// A graph is a collection of nodes and connections between those nodes

// A tree is a type of graph

// Essential Graph Terms
    // Vertex - a node
    // Edge - connection between nodes
    // Weighted/Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
    // Directed/Undirected - directions assigned to distances between vertices

// Undirected Graph
    // No direction to the graph, can move in multiple directions in the graph
    // Ex: Facebook friends graph is undirected (all friends follow each other, in both directions)

// Directed Graph
    // One direction (polarity) to the graph
    // The is a direction assigned to the edges
    // Ex: Instagram is a directed graph (you can follow someone and they don't have to follow you back)

// Weighted Graph
    // When values are assigned to the edges (connections) in the graph
    // Ex: an edge has a value of 17
    // Ex: a map that has assigned distance to the paths (the edges) between locations (the nodes)
